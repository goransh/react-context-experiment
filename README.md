# react-super-context

A tiny wrapper library around the [React Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) that removes a lot of boilerplate required to create and consume contexts.

## Features

* Create contexts with no boilerplate
* No more nested context providers
* Throws an error when consuming a context that has no provider instead of failing silently
* Built with TypeScript
* Small bundle size
